Pathology Practice in MITS Altair Disk Extended Basic

In the late 70s, my next door neighbor, Dr. Norman Pond, had purchased a tricked out PERTEC/MITS 300 Business System (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pertec_Computer) with (I think) a SOROC Monitor and a LA-180 printer.  CPU was a MITS Altair 8080B (turnkey) full of memory.  It had two of the big hard drive modules (a fixed disk with a top loader removable disk--looked like a DEC RL01/RL02--the picture here is a front loader with a cartridge more like an RK05).  He also had the small company he bought it from (Computer Shack in Albuquerque) write the beginning of a pathology practice, then the company went out of business.   So, he had an expensive system that didn't really work very well.  

I was in a rather unique position, as I lived next door and (iirc) was a Senior in High School.  I had built a lot of initial skill as a programmer working on the big DEC Mainframe that our school system had, so he had me look at his machine.   I went on to work for him, mostly part time for a few years.  He paid me $8/hour in 1979.  For a kid right out of High School, that was a damn good paycheck.   I pretty much rewrote his system and made it work.  I also wrote several utilities to emulate the functionality I liked from TOPS-10, like print queueing, a SOS-like editor, and an RUNOFF-like markdown formatter.

Dr Pond used this system until the mid 90s when he couldn't get spare parts for it, so he retired--I think the engineers from his maintenance company which had kept it alive all this time ended up with it for more spare parts.   He died sometime in the mid-2000s.  It was great career starter for me (though it was part of me not really needing to go to College--It was a very wierd point in history), and I'm very thankful to him.  It is also an interesting story about how computerization started during this time, and small businesses finally being able to take part, and an interesting story of Retro Computing.

Anyway, I got a CZUR scanner (from Indigogo--though it took about 6 months for it to arrive--It's a great scanner).   So, I have been scanning documents I have kept for more than 40 years.   So, a lot of this code will just be PDFs.  I am making word ocr scans too, though I don't think these will be that useful to recover the bytes (at least not in a very useful way -- it would be nice if CZUR would simply generate a text file).

I could pretty much fully emulate the above system with the latest versions of SIMH, and I might get some of the tools working -- I don't have much of a need for a pathology practice.
